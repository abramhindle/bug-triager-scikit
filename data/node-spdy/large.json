So, sorry if this is the wrong place.\r\n\r\nAnyhow; I'm trying to get an Express app to run at Nodejitsu with SPDY support. I have SSL set up for the app by doing the default setup by uploading the SSL certificates in the Nodejitsu admin interface so the Nodejitsu loadbalancer / proxy appends the SSL. That is working fine.\r\n\r\nThough, from what I've understood after reading the [docs](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy#options) and [misc issues](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/107) is that in such circumstances the SPDY server should be set to ```plain : true``` and ```ssl : false```.  \r\n\r\niow; my app looks more or less like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar express = require('express');\r\nvar spdy = require('spdy');\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\n// app config and misc routes etc.\r\n\r\nvar options = {\r\n  plain: true,\r\n  ssl: false\r\n};\r\nvar server = spdy.createServer(options, app);\r\nserver.listen(8000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough; when deploying this at Nodejitsu, SPDY is not enabled. I there something I'm missing in this set up in the app side?\r\n\r\nIs there a known way to get SPDY working on Nodejitsu?",

So, sorry if this is the wrong place.\r\n\r\nAnyhow; I'm trying to get an Express app to run at Nodejitsu with SPDY support. I have SSL set up for the app by doing the default setup by uploading the SSL certificates in the Nodejitsu admin interface so the Nodejitsu loadbalancer / proxy appends the SSL. That is working fine.\r\n\r\nThough, from what I've understood after reading the [docs](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy#options) and [misc issues](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy/issues/107) is that in such circumstances the SPDY server should be set to ```plain : true``` and ```ssl : false```.  \r\n\r\niow; my app looks more or less like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar express = require('express');\r\nvar spdy = require('spdy');\r\nvar app = express();\r\n\r\n// app config and misc routes etc.\r\n\r\nvar options = {\r\n  plain: true,\r\n  ssl: false\r\n};\r\nvar server = spdy.createServer(options, app);\r\nserver.listen(8000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough; when deploying this at Nodejitsu, SPDY is not enabled. I there something I'm missing in this set up in the app side?\r\n\r\nIs there a known way to get SPDY working on Nodejitsu?"

The requests are sent indefinitely and can be sent concurrently. My goal is to make sure that both the server and the client are robust enough for my needs.\r\n\r\nWhen I use a small number of concurrent requests, after a while (a few thousands requests total) an error is raised on the client that says:\r\n````\r\nevents.js:72\r\n        throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event\r\n              ^\r\nError: incorrect header check\r\n    at Zlib._binding.onerror (zlib.js:295:17)\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nWhen I increase the number of concurrent requests, the error happens earlier. For instance, with 10 concurrent GET requests, this zlib error is raised after a few hundreds requests.\r\n\r\nI tried to track down the cause of this issue, but I think it might be too deep into node-spdy's implementation for me right now. However, I set up a Git repository that contains two programs, a client and a server, that will help you reproduce this issue. I would appreciate any help on this.\r\n\r\nThe repository can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/jgilli/spdy-zlib-issue/overview . Once you cloned it, here's how to reproduce the problem:\r\n1) run npm install in the local repository.\r\n2) enter _./node_spdy_server.js -p 4243 --plain_ to launch the server.\r\n3) enter _./node_spdy_client.js -p 4243 --plain --requests 10_ to launch the client.\r\n\r\nThis will print a lot of output on the console, and usually I find it easier to launch the two programs in two separate terminals. The zlib error should be raised pretty quickly with _--requests 10_ . \r\n\r\nIf you have any question, feel free to ask. Thank you!",

When the connection stream signals that its buffer is full (`connection.write()` returns `false`)  then we don't write any more until the there's free buffer space in the connection stream.

After that I tested it with Firefox 11 (which now has SPDY but disabled). I enabled SPDY and tried it against the node-spdy proxy. The server that is being proxied used the \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" header and did not provide a \"Content-Length\" header, which made Firefox Croak.\r\n\r\nI then filed a [bug with Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=736023), but the guys there pointed me at the [SPDY specification](http://dev.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-protocol/spdy-protocol-draft2) which states that: **Chunked encodings in spdy/2 are not valid**.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises at which level this needs to be fixed. Mozilla obviously is of the opinion that the specification is king, so they will not fix it in the browser. On the other hand, I can't ask the downstream server to avoid chunked encoding, since I may not even be mine. So there remain 2 possible places:\r\n\r\n 1. The proxy (I use node-proxy for this)\r\n 2. The SPDY Implementation (node-spdy)\r\n\r\nI personally think that node-spdy would be the right place to do this. Since it has the same general properties as the built in HTTPS server and the adoption will only ever happen if it is trivial to use this via node. This is also the reason that the built in HTTP server does the same when the HTTP version of the client is below 1.1.\r\n\r\nBasic research has shown me that since I don't know the content-length at the time of writeHead() I would need to intercept that call and then buffer the result that is written by write() and then tally the total-length on end() and set \"Transfer-Encoding: identity\" and \"Content-Length\". Then writeHead() for real and write() all the chunks and call end();\r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage of this approach is that I need to buffer the entire reply, which may be a lot of memory if there are a lot of requests.\r\n\r\nThe question is are you interested in me creating a patch that does this and are there any guidelines you want to apply if you do.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPhil\r\n\r\n",
